\section{Initial Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gain familiarity and confidence within the Linux command-line environment
\item Learn how to navigate directories, as well as to copy, move \& delete the files within them
\item Look up the name of a command needed to perform a specified task
\end{enumerate}


\section{Background}
Command-line tools are the mainstay of analysis of large biological data sets.
Good candidate examples for command-line analysis are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Manual inspection of fastq, bam \& sam files from NGS pipelines
\item Automating similar analyses across multiple datasets
\item Manipulations of data which are repetitive or laborious to perform manually
\item Any analysis that is different from what is available in programs with graphical interfaces (i.e. GUIs).
\item Job submission to HPC clusters
\end{itemize}  

Recording all processes as simple scripts also makes an entire analysis more reproducible, as you will have \textit{a record of every procedure you have performed}.
It's amazing how often you'll need to revisit something you have performed months ago, and having records of what you've done is immensely useful.
From the perspective of an ``electronic lab book", this is also very important.\\

Today we'll explore a few commands to help you gain a little familiarity with some important ones, and to enable you to find help when you're working by yourself.
We don't expect you to remember all the commands \& options from today.
The important thing is to become familiar with the basic syntax for commands, how to put them together, and where to look for help when you're unsure.

\section{Finding your way around}
\begin{note}
Firstly we need to open a terminal, so \textbf{click on the terminal icon} at the bottom of the desktop.
There are several variants of the shell, such as the \textit{Bourne-again} shell (i.e. \texttt{bash}) and the \textit{C-shell} (please feel free to make all the jokes you can think of).
The terminal has a library of commands which are built into it at the time of installing the operating system, and which are part of the Bourne-again Shell, or \textit{bash}.
(Historically, it's a replacement for the earlier Bourne Shell, written by Stephen Bourne, so the name is actually a hilarious pun.)
We'll explore a few of these commands below, and the words shell or bash will often be used interchangeably with the terminal window.
Our apologies to any purists.
If you've ever heard of the phrase \textit{shell scripts}, this refers to a series of these commands strung together into a text file which is then able to be executed as a single command.\\
\end{note}

\begin{note}
When you open the terminal on your VM, you'll see the phrase \texttt{hub@biohub:}$\sim$.
This is simply username@computername:, and you may remember you logged on as \texttt{hub} during the setup.
The tilde ($\sim$) represents a shorthand for your home directory, but we'll explore this more later.
\end{note}

\subsection{Where are we?}

\begin{note}
When navigating through the folders on any computer, we are all very familiar with clicking through from one folder to another.
The folder currently being displayed is usually given in the header of the folder view, so we know where we are currently looking.
When using \texttt{bash}, we don't click on anything so we need to type commands to change directories, and inspect the contents.
\end{note}

\begin{steps}
The first thing we need to do is find where we are, when we open \texttt{bash}.
Type the command \texttt{pwd} in the terminal and you will see the output \texttt{/home/hub} appear.
\begin{lstlisting}
pwd
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

\begin{information}
The command \texttt{pwd} is what we use for \underline{\textbf{p}}rinting the current (i.e. \underline{\textbf{w}}orking) \underline{\textbf{d}}irectory.
Printing in this context means to print some information to the terminal, as opposed to a physical printer.
This style of printing harks back to the days when laser printers were not commonplace.
Printing information to the terminal itself is what we refer to as printing to the \textit{standard output} or \texttt{stdout}.
\end{information}

\begin{note}
The directory path that appeared  (\texttt{/home/hub})  is what will be referred to as your \textit{home directory} for the remainder of the workshop.

\texttt{ls -lS } \\
\end{answer}

Many software tools create ``\textit{hidden}" files by starting their name with a dot.
By default, these files won't be displayed using \texttt{ls}
How could we make \texttt{ls}  display these files as well as the main set of visible files.

\begin{answer}
\texttt{ls -a } \\
\end{answer}
\end{questions}

\begin{bonus}
We can actually find out more about the \texttt{less} pager by calling it's own \texttt{man} page.
Type the command \\
\begin{lstlisting}
man less
\end{lstlisting}
 and the complete page will appear.
This can look a little overwhelming, so try pressing \texttt{h} which will take you to a summary of the shortcut keys within \texttt{less}.
There are a lot of them, so try out a few to jump through the file. \\

A good one to experiment with would be to search for patterns within the displayed text by prefacing the pattern with a slash.
Try searching for a common word like \textit{``the''} or \textit{``to''} to see how the function behaves, then try searching for something a bit more useful, like the word \textit{``move"}. \\
\end{bonus}

\subsection{Accessing Manuals or Help Pages}
\begin{information}
As well as entering the command \texttt{man} before the name of a command you need help with, you can often just enter the name of the command with the options \texttt{-h} or \texttt{-{}-help} specified.
Note the convention of a single hyphen which indicates an individual letter will follow, or a double-hyphen which indicates that a word will follow.
Unfortunately the methods can vary a little from command to command, so if one method doesn't get you the manual, just try one of the others.\\

Sometimes it can take a little bit of looking to find something and it's important to be realise we won't break the computer or accidentally launch a nuclear bomb when we look around.
It's very much like picking up a piece of paper to see what's under it.
If you don't find something  at first, just keep looking and you'll find it eventually.\\
\end{information}

\begin{questions}
Try accessing the manual for the command \texttt{man} all three ways. 
Was there a difference in the output depending on how we asked to view the manual?\\
\begin{answer}
Yes.
Accessing the manual using \texttt{man man} displayed it a page at a time using \texttt{less}.
The other two options just printed the entire contents all at once.\\
\end{answer}


Could we access the help page for the command \texttt{ls} all three ways? \\
\begin{answer}
No.
The option \texttt{-h} gives the output in human readable format.
However, the other two methods work.\\
\end{answer}
\end{questions}

\subsection{Some Useful Commands}
\begin{steps}
So far we have explored the commands \texttt{pwd}, \texttt{cd}, \texttt{ls} \& \texttt{man} as well as the pager \texttt{less}.
Inspect the \texttt{man} pages for the commands in the following table  \& fill in the appropriate fields.
Have a look at the useful options \& try to understand what they will do if specified when invoking the command. \\

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm} | p{8.5cm} | p{4.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Command} & \textbf{Description of function} & \textbf{Useful options} \\ \hline
\texttt{man} & Display on-line manual & -k (search for keywords if you don't know the command) \\ \hline
\texttt{pwd} & Print working directory, i.e show where you are & none commonly used \\ \hline
\texttt{ls} & List contents of a directory & -a, -h, -l, -S, -t, -R \\ \hline
\texttt{cd} & Change directory & (scroll down in \texttt{man builtins} to find \texttt{cd}) \\ \hline
\texttt{mv} & & -b, -f, -u \\ \hline
\texttt{cp} & & -b, -f, -u \\ \hline
\texttt{rm} & & -r (careful...) \\ \hline
\texttt{rmdir} & & \\ \hline
\texttt{mkdir} & & -p\\ \hline
\texttt{cat} & & \\ \hline
%\texttt{less} & & \\ \hline
\texttt{wc} & & -l \\ \hline
\texttt{head} & & -n \\ \hline
\texttt{tail} & & -n \\ \hline
\texttt{echo} & &  -e\\ \hline
\texttt{cut} & & -d, -f, -s \\ \hline
\texttt{sort} & & \\ \hline
\texttt{uniq} & & -c \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{steps}

%\begin{bonus}
%Sometimes the side effects of a command can also be useful. 
%We can use \texttt{touch} to create an empty file using the command string \texttt{touch filename}.
%Look at the \texttt{man} page for the command \texttt{touch} \& see if you can find this functionality described in the help page. \\
%\end{bonus}

\subsection{Tab auto-complete}
\begin{steps}
A very helpful \& time-saving tool in the command line is the ability to automatically complete a command, file or directory name using the \texttt{\textless tab \textgreater} key.
Try typing 
\begin{lstlisting}
ls /home/h <tab>
\end{lstlisting}
where \texttt{\textless tab \textgreater} represents the tab key.
\end{steps}
\begin{information}
Notice how the word \texttt{hub} is completed automatically!
This functionality will automatically fill as far as it can until conflicting options are reached.
In this case, there was only one option so it was able to complete all the way to the end of the file path. 
This enables us to quickly enter long file paths without the risk of typos. 
Using this trick will save you an enormous amount of time trying to find why something doesn't work.
The most common error we'll see today will be mistakes in file paths caused by people not taking advantage of this trick.\\
\end{information}

\begin{steps}
Now enter
\begin{lstlisting}
ls /Do <tab>
\end{lstlisting}
and it will look like the auto-complete is not working.
This is because there are two possibilities \& it doesn't know which you want.
Hit the tab twice and both will appear in the terminal, then choose one.
As well as directory paths, you can use this to auto-complete filenames.
\end{steps}

\begin{advanced}
This technique can be used to also find command names.
Type in \texttt{he} followed by two strike of the \texttt{\textless tab \textgreater} key and it will show you all of the commands that being with the string \texttt{he}, such as \texttt{head}, \texttt{help} or any others that may be installed on your computer.
If we'd hit the \texttt{\textless tab \textgreater} key after typing \texttt{hea}, then the command \texttt{head} would have auto-completed, although clearly this wouldn't have saved you any typing.
\end{advanced}

\section{Putting It All Together}
Now we can use some the above commands to perform something useful. 

\subsection{Creating and Viewing a File}

\begin{steps}
First, let's create a personal directory under \texttt{/home/hub} with your first name as the directory name.
\textbf{Where you see \textit{firstname} below, use your actual firstname.}\\
\begin{lstlisting}
cd mkdir firstname
\end{lstlisting}

Now we can change into this directory.
\begin{lstlisting}
cd firstname
\end{lstlisting}

Create an empty text file.
Check the \texttt{man} page for \texttt{touch} if you're not sure about this line.
\begin{lstlisting}
touch hello.txt
\end{lstlisting}

We can read it, but it won't have anything in it yet.
\begin{lstlisting}
cat hello.txt
\end{lstlisting}

Obviously nothing was printed to your terminal in the previous line because the file is empty.
Let's write something to the file, then try reading it again.
In the following line, the symbol \texttt{>>} places the text \textbf{at the end} of whatever is already in the file.
As the file is empty, this will just write a single line.
\begin{lstlisting}
echo "Hello" >> hello.txt
cat hello.txt
\end{lstlisting}

We can find a whole lot of information about the file.
\begin{lstlisting}
wc hello.txt
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

\begin{questions}
In the previous line, what do the three numbers represent?
\begin{answer}
The lines, word \& bytes (or characters)
\end{answer}
\end{questions}

\begin{information}
When we added the word \texttt{Hello} to our file, we used the symbol $>>$ which actually wrote the word to the end of the file.
As the file was completely empty, this placed the word in the first line.
This is a VERY handy short-cut for writing information to the end of a file
\end{information}

\begin{steps}
Now let's add more to the file.
\begin{lstlisting}
echo "It's me" >> hello.txt
cat hello.txt
wc hello.txt
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

\begin{note}
For most of the above commands we could have used the auto-complete feature of the bash terminal.
Did you remember this trick?
\end{note}

\subsection{Copying and Renaming a File}

Later today, we're going to look through a file containing a list of words.
It's currently on your VM in the folder \texttt{/usr/share/dict} and has the name \texttt{cracklib-small}.
Let's copy this to your \texttt{firstname} folder, in your home directory.

\begin{steps}

\begin{lstlisting}
cp /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small /firstname
\end{lstlisting}

Next we will rename the file.
Note, that in bash there is no ``rename" tool.
Instead we ``move" from it's current location to any location we choose, with whatever name we choose.
In the following, the location is the same so we are effectively just giving the file a new name.\\
\begin{lstlisting}
mv /firstname/cracklib-small /firstname/words
\end{lstlisting}

We can look at the first 5 lines of the file using \\
\begin{lstlisting}
head -n5 /firstname/words
\end{lstlisting}

Or we can look at the last 10 lines of the file using \\
\begin{lstlisting}
tail -n10 /firstname/words
\end{lstlisting}

We could even page through the file using \texttt{less}.
(Remember to hit \texttt{q} to exit the pager.)\\
\begin{lstlisting}
less /firstname/words
\end{lstlisting}

We can even find how many lines there are in the file by using \\
\begin{lstlisting}
wc -l /firstname/words
\end{lstlisting}

\end{steps}

\begin{questions}
Did we need to enter the full file path in the above commands, or could we have saved ourselves some effort by changing into the \texttt{\骈蝮纛犴妪溟蝈泗矧苘茆彗轭犷篦弪馘蟋麇泔蹯栳鲥汨犷珏轭麸翳荇屮趑酐荥骈蝮纛犴妪溟蝈泗矧堞牾篝孱翦蝈翳骈戾钺礤苠钿犷篦弪苠钿聃弩糸镱簖茔戾狎疳珏荏邈糸镱吁眄狎物麇栳鲥屮疱蜷孱沐轭箦鲥蜥脲翎箅麒殂狎箫礤镦翳盹篝泔眄镱翎箅铄邃邃骘犷忾镩铈矧磲糸泱犷犰箝蟋矧骘犷珏铄蜥刃躞徵瀹茆彗轭孱蹴弪狒妪荛翦蕊麸徙沐篌磲铛犰苘荛翦蕊麸泸遽翦犷钺鲩玑翦翳蝻蹒溟蝈泗矧殄筌荛翦蕊麸泸遽翦犷鲩鬻骈戾筌荛翦蕊麸泔瘗盹鲥犷蝈钺礤骈戾苠钿孱蹴弪狒妪
